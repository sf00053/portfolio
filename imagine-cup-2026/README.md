#Imagine Cup 2026
This is our Launch proposal for the Imagine Cup 2026 by Microsoft. We focus on the education, as students and a me as a Tutor in college. My teamate and I wanted to do a Personalized Study Coach focus on misconceptions that students may have in some topics of Computer Science.

This Personalized Coach would use Azure to provide personalized feedback to the students, beacuse when offering the tutoring meetings, sometimes we cannot cover all the stuff that the students needs to. This Coach would help them outside of the classes, and also not giving the answers directly, that way they can first try to think the answers.
